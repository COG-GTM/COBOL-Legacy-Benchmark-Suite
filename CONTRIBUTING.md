# Contributing to COBOL-Legacy-Benchmark-Suite (CLBS)

## Introduction

Thank you for considering contributing to CLBS. This project serves as a benchmark suite for testing COBOL modernization and translation solutions, so contributions should focus on enhancing its effectiveness in this role while maintaining realistic mainframe patterns.

## Development Setup

To get started with contributing, follow these steps:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/COG-GTM/COBOL-Legacy-Benchmark-Suite.git
$ cd COBOL-Legacy-Benchmark-Suite
```

Review the README for project overview and the system architecture document at `documentation/technical/system-architecture.md` for detailed component information. Since this is a COBOL reference implementation, no build or runtime environment is required for code contributions, though a COBOL-aware editor (VS Code with COBOL extension, Micro Focus, or similar) is recommended.

## Ways to Contribute

### 1. Enhancing Test Coverage

- Adding new COBOL patterns not currently covered
- Expanding existing scenarios with edge cases
- Contributing additional test data
- Creating new validation criteria

### 2. Documentation Improvements

- Clarifying technical specifications
- Adding examples of usage
- Documenting common translation challenges
- Expanding test scenario documentation

### 3. Business Logic Extensions

- Adding realistic financial calculations
- Contributing industry-standard processing patterns
- Implementing additional COBOL idioms
- Expanding error handling scenarios

## Technical Guidelines

### COBOL Code Standards

1. **Maintainability**

   - Use meaningful variable names

   000000     05  FOLLOW-NAMING-CONVENTIONS PIC 9(05).
   ```

3. **Coding Patterns**
   - Use level 88 conditions appropriately
   - Follow copybook organization standards
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Use structured programming techniques
